Degree of an Array
Description
Given an array of integers, its degree is defined as the number of occurrences of the element that occurs most frequently in the array. Given a list of integers, determine two properties:

the degree of the array
the length of the shortest sub-array that shares that degree


Example

arr = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2]



The array has a degree of 2 based on the occurrences of values 1 and 2. The subarray of degree 2 based on the 1's is [1, 2, 1] and based on 2's is [2, 1, 3, 2]. Their lengths are 3 and 4, so the shortest is length 3. Return the shortest length.



Function Description

Complete the function degreeOfArray in the editor below. The function must return an integer denoting the minimum size of the subarray such that the degree of the subarray is equal to the degree of the array.



degreeOfArray has the following parameter(s):

    int arr[n]:  an array of integers indexed from 0 to n-1

Return

    int:  the minimum size of the subarrays that have a degree equal to the degree of the array


Constraints

2 ≤ n ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i]≤ 106

Sample Output

2
Explanation

The array arr  has a degree of 2 based on elements values 1 and 2 because each occurs two times. The subarrays with a degree of 2 are:

[1, 2, 2, 3, 1], which has a length of 5.
[2, 2], which has a length of 2.


Return minimum( 2, 5 ) = 2
